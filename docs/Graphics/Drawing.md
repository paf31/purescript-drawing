### Re-exported from Color:

#### `ColorSpace`

``` purescript
data ColorSpace
  = RGB
  | HSL
  | LCh
  | Lab
```

Definition of a color space.

* `RGB`: red, green, blue
* `HSL`: hue, saturation, lightness
* `LCh`: Lightness, chroma, hue
* `Lab`: Lightness, a, b

#### `Color`

``` purescript
data Color
```

The representation of a color.

Note:
- The `Eq` instance compares two `Color`s by comparing their (integer) RGB
  values. This is different from comparing the HSL values (for example,
  HSL has many different representations of black (arbitrary hue and
  saturation values).
- Colors outside the sRGB gamut which cannot be displayed on a typical
  computer screen can not be represented by `Color`.


##### Instances
``` purescript
Show Color
Eq Color
```

#### `xyz`

``` purescript
xyz :: Number -> Number -> Number -> Color
```

Create a `Color` from XYZ coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space. Note
that a `Color` always represents a color in the sRGB gamut (colors that
can be represented on a typical computer screen) while the XYZ color space
is bigger. This function will tend to create fully saturated colors at the
edge of the sRGB gamut if the coordinates lie outside the sRGB range.

See:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB

#### `toXYZ`

#### `toRGBA'`
